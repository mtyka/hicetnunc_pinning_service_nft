# IPFS Pinning Service for HicEtNunc inside an NFT

This NFT is both an art piece and a service.  By collecting this NFT your are registering for a service that will keep all your
creations and your collection pinned on IPFS, such that the metadata and file contents (your image, movie or whatever) 
are not garbage collected by IPFS (as they otherwise will be eventually). This service promise will run 
for one year.

## WHAT DO I GET BY PURCHASING THIS NFT ?
a) You collect the first NFT art project of it's kind. It provides more than a pretty picture. Its a service promise
wrapped in an NFT.
b) You purchase my honest commitment to do my best to pin the collection and creations associated with your Tezos wallet
on my IPFS node for one year. This service contract will end on April 2nd, 2022.  Read the terms and conditions below.

## WHAT? TELL ME MORE! 
HicEtNunc NFTs store their metadata and content on [IPFS](ipfs.io) (Interplanetary Filesystem).
Unfortunately IPFS does not guarantee that files will be kept around indefinitely unless an IPFS
node "pins" the files. Unpinned files can be dropped theoretically at any time, which will for all 
intents and purposes destroy the NFT they were associated with. Remember: the only thing that is immortalized on the block chain is the link to an IPFS file, nothing more.
That IPFS file may disappear at any time, unless it is pinned. Pinning requires someone to run an IPFS node, ping the file and host it on their harddrive, 
i.e this costs actual money. Your purchase will contribute to the hosting of your files and maintanance of the service. 

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS 
Owning this NFT automatically adds you to a list of Tezos wallets who's creations and collections will be pinned on IPFS.
This service is an art project and is not legally binding and will be performed in an an honest best-effort manner. 
If high reliability is required we suggest running your own IPFS node and pinning your own NFTs. 
The pin list will be updated nightly, as far as possible, subject to limitations including but not limited to distrubtions in internet connectivity.
The author and artist assumes no responsibility for any service distruptions even if they lead to loss of data associated with on IPFS. 
This service contract will end on April 2nd, 2022 and the service may or may not be discontinued, potentially leading to the loss of data.
By purchasing this NFT you agree to the terms in this file and agrees to hold the creator of this NFT harmless in the case of loss of data associated with their NFTs.
The final, valid, applicable and most uptodate version of this agreement is ONLY found on https://www.github.com/mtyka/hicetnunc_pin_service
Being added to the block-lists on HicEtNunc disqualifies you from this service. The operator of this service reserves the right to 
deny service to anyone, at any time, for any reason.
